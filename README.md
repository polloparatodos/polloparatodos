### Hi, I'm Ryan

I'm a Full Stack Developer that has been in the web hosting industry since 2010. I've been deeply involved with everything from product support to systems engineering, and SDET automation to deployment architecture. Might sound like a ton of buzzwords, but a decade has brought me ton of opportunities and exposure, and I like getting involved in everything I can.

I'm interested in DevOps, Automation, and Software Engineering. I've created QA peer programs and managed testing infrastructure, regulations software, and systems monitoring solutions. I'm currently finishing up my Bachelor of Science - BS focused in Computer Software Engineering from Southern New Hampshire University. 

My recent languages/tools: JavaScript (NodeJS), MySQL (MariaDB), Cypress.IO, Nomad, Vault, Perl
