# Hi, I'm Ryan (aka polloparatodos)

Welcome to my personal GitHub repository! I'm a DevOps Engineer passionate about automation, open-source contributions, and exploring diverse programming languages. This space serves as a hub for my experiments, projects, and learning endeavors.

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects & Highlights

- **[radiofreq](https://github.com/polloparatodos/radiofreq)**: A Ruby gem that converts radio frequencies into their corresponding band names. For instance, inputting `446.000 MHz` returns `"Ultra High Frequency (UHF)"`. This tool is handy for ham radio enthusiasts and developers working with RF data.

- **[particle-breaker](https://github.com/polloparatodos/particle-breaker)**: A C++ project focused on simulating particle interactions. It's an exploration into physics simulations and computational modeling.

- **[factorizationalisms](https://github.com/polloparatodos/factorizationalisms)**: A Python-based project delving into number theory and factorization algorithms. It's a playground for mathematical computations and algorithm optimization.

- **[WebIO.jl](https://github.com/polloparatodos/WebIO.jl)**: A fork of the JuliaGizmos/WebIO.jl project, aiming to bridge the gap between Julia and web technologies. It facilitates the creation of interactive web interfaces for Julia applications.

- **[class-data-inheritable](https://github.com/polloparatodos/class-data-inheritable)**: A Perl module that provides inheritable and overridable class data. It's a utility for object-oriented Perl programming, enhancing code reusability and modularity.

## About Me

- **Profession**: DevOps Engineer at [cPanel](https://cpanel.net/)
- **Graduate Studies**: Currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) at Baylor University, with interests in cryptography, reverse engineering, and discrete mathematics .
- **Location**: Texas, USA
- **Timezone**: Central Time (UTC -05:00)
- **Interests**: Automation, open-source software, programming languages (Ruby, Python, Julia, C++, Perl), and continuous learning.

## üíª Programming Interests

I enjoy pushing the boundaries of code through:

- **Code Golf** ‚Äì Writing the shortest and most clever code possible
- **Quines** ‚Äì Programs that reproduce their own source code
- **Mathematical Challenges** ‚Äì Solving problems like those on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net), especially those involving number theory and computational logic
